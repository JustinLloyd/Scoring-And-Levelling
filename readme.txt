A couple of small c# scripts for Unity that make tracking the player's score
and level very easy. There is also an arcade-style trickle scoring script
that works in conjunction with the scoring script.

An older version of the script, with a brief write-up, is available at
http://www.otakunozoku.com/score-and-level-system-for-unity3d/
